# MedFusion AI üöÄ  
**Multi-Disease Diagnostic Platform**  

MedFusion AI is the Final Year Capstone Project developed under the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at MIT World Peace University. This platform integrates AI-driven diagnostics with edge computing, hosted on a Raspberry Pi, to provide affordable and accessible disease detection for conditions such as COVID-19, Diabetes, Brain Tumors, and Breast Cancer.

Designed for underserved and remote regions, MedFusion AI leverages individual machine learning models tailored to each disease, offering precise and efficient health assessments. With a focus on portability, privacy, and offline functionality, the platform addresses critical gaps in healthcare accessibility and early detection.

 

## Features üåü  
- **Multi-Disease Detection**: AI models tailored for specific conditions.  
- **Offline Operation**: Works seamlessly in resource-constrained areas without the need for constant internet connectivity.  
- **Privacy-Preserving**: All data is processed locally on the Raspberry Pi.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible dashboard for healthcare providers and non-specialists.

## System Overview üõ†Ô∏è  
**Objective**: To democratize healthcare diagnostics with an AI-powered platform that bridges healthcare gaps in remote areas.  

Key functionalities:  
- Raspberry Pi 4 -powered diagnostic platform.  
- Disease detection models trained for medical imaging and health metrics.  
- Real-time results displayed in a unified web interface.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è  
### System Components:  
1. **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**: The core hardware for hosting the platform.  
2. **Flask Backend**: Handles user requests, processes inputs, and serves predictions.  
3. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - **CNN** for image-based diagnostics (COVID-19, Brain Tumors).  
   - **Random Forest** for health metrics (Diabetes, Breast Cancer).  
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensures input compatibility with models.  
5. **User Interface**: Intuitive web-based dashboard for diagnostics and reporting.  

### Workflow:  
1. User uploads medical data (images or metrics).  
2. Data is preprocessed to meet model requirements.  
3. Disease-specific AI models generate predictions.  
4. Results are displayed in real-time through the interface.
